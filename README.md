# Welcome to Cloud Rendered Project!

Hi! This project utilizes the GLSL shader language along with rendering techniques like raytracing, bounding volume hierarchies, and other real-time techniques in order to create rendering of volumetric clouds and gases.

## Example output:
Night sky (view from below) and morning sky (view from above).
